# So let me get this straight; #
Rob Ford's friend and owner of Muzik nightclub, the sole nightclub in the exhibition petitions the board to ban "EDM" events and they do it?  **What fucking planet is this?**

There's so much wrong with this I don't even know where to start.

### Follow the money ###
Let's try revenue; the city is losing somewhere around one million dollars per year in revenue.  There's nothing to explain there.  We're losing money.

But, who stands to gain what is likely a significant chunk of that revenue?  Oh, right, our buddy "Z" over at Muzik.

### What the fuck is EDM anyway? ###
I challenge the dipshits over at the board of the Ex to give me a definition ** *other* ** than "EDM" of what they just banned.  What constitutes "EDM"?  Is it just that shitty progressive house and "clubstep" (you heard that one here first folks) that guys like Pauly D and Deadmau5 pump their fists to, or does that extend to guys like Richie Hawtin who play what is quite objectively techno?  What about Raggae?  Dub?  What about all that bassy shit around 140 that isn't dub,
dubstep or raggae but a nice blend of all those?  What about bands who incorporate electronic music gear and music into their acts like RadioHead?  What about electronic musicians like Boards of Canada or Minilogue who aren't all dance-y...  My point is this; you can't just call all electronic music EDM and ban it as neatly as these mouth-breathers think they've done.  Most hip-hop these days is made entirely with computers and electonic gear, is that banned?  Which brings
me to my next point:

### It's all about the Benjamins  ###

City councillor Giorgio Mammoliti stated publicly that he moved this motion to protect kids from drugs.  The guy who defended Rob Ford even after it was well apparent that our Chief Magistrate was  in to gettin' drunk and smokin' a little rock every once in a while.  Meanwhile, all you "damned kids" just looking to get high on MDMA and dry-hump each other to barely-tolerable Swedish House Mafia tunes for a few hours can go fuck yourselves.  Doing drugs is a privilege reserved for the
rich and powerful.
This isn't about keeping kids off drugs, if it were the city would hold *more* events at the Ex for teens.  No, this is about influence peddling, plain and simple.

### So what now? ###

Write your city councillor.  Write what's left of the Mayor's office.  Boycott Muzik.  Seriously, fuck that guy, don't go there.
