My second release “Deep State” is now available on [Bandcamp](http://srennordstrm.bandcamp.com).
It’s the product of a tonne of work by myself and a few others who were kind enough to be involved in the project.  If you can’t swing the $5 (CAD) for it, just wait a few more days and it’ll be released on [Ektoplazm](http://ektoplazm.com).
I hope you enjoy it.
